# Instructable for 1602 LCD Screen

## What We are Doing
This project provides a means of viewing input and output data.  It is particularly useful when a serial connection to a computer screen is unavailable or impractical.

The 1602 LCD screen displays 16 characters on each of two lines.

## Hardware
![LCD1602](./LCD1602.png)
* 1602 LCD Screen
* Headers to solder to the screen<sup> * </sup>
* Arduino microcontroller<sup> ** </sup>
* Arduino USB cable
* 10k ohm potentiometer
* 220 ohm resistor
* Protoboard
* Male-to-Male connector wires

<sup> * </sup>Where space permits, 2 x 8-pin stackable headers are recommended.

<sup> ** </sup>This example is for an Arduino Uno.

## Libraries
The 1602 screen requires a library – LiquidCrystal.h.  However, this library is already part of the standard Arduino IDE, so you do not need to download or install any libraries.

## Wiring Diagram

## Example Code
The example code can be copied/downloaded from:

	https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HelloWorld

The program prints “Hello World” on the first line of the LCD and a counter, which updates every second, on the second line.


```c++
/*
  LiquidCrystal Library - Hello World

 Demonstrates the use a 16x2 LCD display.  The LiquidCrystal
 library works with all LCD displays that are compatible with the
 Hitachi HD44780 driver. There are many of them out there, and you
 can usually tell them by the 16-pin interface.

 This sketch prints "Hello World!" to the LCD
 and shows the time.

  The circuit:
 * LCD RS pin to digital pin 12
 * LCD Enable pin to digital pin 11
 * LCD D4 pin to digital pin 5
 * LCD D5 pin to digital pin 4
 * LCD D6 pin to digital pin 3
 * LCD D7 pin to digital pin 2
 * LCD R/W pin to ground
 * LCD VSS pin to ground
 * LCD VCC pin to 5V
 * 10K resistor:
 * ends to +5V and ground
 * wiper to LCD VO pin (pin 3)

// include the library code:
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>

// initialize the library with the numbers of the interface pins
LiquidCrystal lcd(12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2);

void setup() {
  // set up the LCD's number of columns and rows:
  lcd.begin(16, 2);
  // Print a message to the LCD.
  lcd.print("hello, world!");
}

void loop() {
  // set the cursor to column 0, line 1
  // (note: line 1 is the second row, since counting begins with 0):
  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
  // print the number of seconds since reset:
  lcd.print(millis() / 1000);
}
```

## Making It Better
* Modify the above program to read the potentiometer and post the reading to the second line of the screen.

* Modify the above program to echo a message typed in from the serial monitor.

* The project described above uses a lot of pins – 6 to control the LCD and another to control the backlighting.  Adafruit has a shield that reduces the number of pins needed to 2.

    However, you can make your own circuit to reduce the number of pins required.  Here’s some help:
