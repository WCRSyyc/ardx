  Turn a Transistor on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  The circuit:
    NPN Transistor connected from digital pin 2 (base) to ground (emitter).
    The load (here a relay) connected to power (5V) from transistor collector

 Created 16 Aug 2020
 based on an original by H. Barragan for the Wiring i/o board

const int DRIVE_PIN = 2;    // Transistor base connected to digital pin 2

// The setup() method runs once, when the sketch starts

void setup()
{
  // initialize the digital pin as an output:
  pinMode(DRIVE_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop() method runs over and over again,
// as long as the Arduino has power

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(DRIVE_PIN, HIGH);// turn the Green LED on
  delay(1000);                  // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(DRIVE_PIN, LOW); // turn the Red LED on
  delay(1000);                  // wait for a second
}
