		<h2>What We're Doing</h2>
		<p>We have caused one LED to blink, now it's time to up the stakes. Lets connect eight. We'll also have an opportunity to stretch the Arduino a bit by creating various lighting sequences. This circuit is also a nice setup to experiment with writing your own programs and getting a feel for how the Arduino works.</p>
		<p>Along with controlling the LEDs we start looking into a few simple programming methods to keep your programs small.</p>
		<p>for() loops - used when you want to run a piece of code several times.<br/>
			arrays[] - used to make managing variables easier (it's a group of variables).</p>

		<h2>Not Working? <span>(3 things to try)</span></h2>
		<div>
			<h3>Some LEDs Fail to Light</h3>
			<p>It is easy to insert an LED backwards. Check the LEDs that aren't working and ensure they the right way around.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Operating out of sequence</h3>
			<p>With eight wires it's easy to cross a couple. Double check that the first LED is plugged into pin 2 and each pin there after.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Starting Afresh</h3>
			<p>Its easy to accidentally misplace a wire without noticing. Pulling everything out and starting with a fresh slate is often easier than trying to track down the problem.</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section id="CIRC-makingBetter">
		<h2>Making it Better?</h2>
		<h3>Switching to Loops:</h3>
		<p>in the loop() function there are 4 lines. The last three all start with a '//' this means the line is treated as a comment (not run). To switch the program to use loops change the void loop() code to:</p>
		<pre>//oneAfterAnotherNoLoop();
oneAfterAnotherLoop();
//oneOnAtATime();
//inAndOut();</pre>
		<p>Upload the program, and notice that nothing has changed. You can take a look at the two functions, each does the same thing, but use different approaches (hint the second one uses a for loop)</p>
		<h3>Extra Animations:</h3>
		<p>Tired of this animation? Then try the other two sample animations. Uncomment their lines and upload the program to your board and enjoy the new light animations. (delete the slashes in front of row 3 and then 4)</p>
		<h3>Testing out your own Animations:</h3>
		<p>Jump into the included code and start changing things. The main point is to turn an LED on use:</p>
		<pre>  digitalWrite(pinNumber, HIGH);</pre>
		<p>Then to turn it off use;</p>
		<pre>  digitalWrite(pinNumber, LOW);</pre>
		<p>"pinNumber" needs to be a number (2-9), or a variable that is set to a number in that range.</p>
		<p>Type away, regardless of what you change you won't break anything.</p>
