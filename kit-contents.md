## Notes

### <a name="note_brick">⚓</a> 9V power supply

The Oomlout ARDX kit comes with a holder for 5 AA batteries.  The way we see the kit being used, the brick seems more useful.  Replacing batteries can get expensive, and the kit is typically being used where wall power is available.

### <a name="note_case">⚓</a> Plastic Case

This is a clear plastic, shoe box sized box that can hold in progress projects.  The kit can be put away, without needed to first remove the wires and parts from the breadboard.

### <a name="note_clone">⚓</a> Arduino clone

These Arduino UNO class boards use the CH340 USB to serial chip.  Some versions of some operating systems have problems communicating with these.  When that happens, normally the problem can be resolved by installing a specific driver for the chip.  A web search for "arduino ch340" provides lots of information.

### <a name="note_wire">⚓</a> Jumper Wire Bundle

This is a single bundle of male to male dupont connection wires,  Individual wire can pulled off from the edges of the bundle.

### <a name="note_led">⚓</a> LEDs

All of the LED´s included in the kit appear `clear` when not being used.  The red and green LEDs are packaged in labelled plastic bags to keep them separate initially.  You will likely have to test them individually later.  Once a few experiments have been created and disassembled, the LEDs will likely end up mixed together.

### <a name="note_motor1">⚓</a> Toy DC Motor (without wire leads)

The solder tabs on the motor are relatively fragile.  It is very easy to break them off while working with the motor.  We recommend soldering wire leads to the tabs, then attaching the leads to the body of the motor the motor, to provide strain relief.  With the wire leads solidly connected to the motor body, pulling on the ends will not pull on the solder tabs.  A zip tie, or hot glue can be used to fasten the wires to the motor body.

### <a name="note_header1">⚓</a> 40 Pin male header
